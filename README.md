# DailyCP
This repository contains my work from the website Daily Coding Problem. The best approach in my opinion would be using
Python for my answers, but I am using Java since I want to retain my Java knowledge. 
It should be noted that because I am using Java, some of the problems are not solvable as the questions are meant to be
answered using Python.
